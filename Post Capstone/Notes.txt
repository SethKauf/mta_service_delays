** Note **

(June 28, 2022): I want to go back to the drawing board on some parts of this project, so I've reverted it to what it looked like at the end of the Capstone in the meantime.

(Apr 25, 2022): Currently experiencing some deployment issues with Flask/Heroku. Cleaning up this folder for continuity.

(Mar 14, 2022): Finished analysis and modeling. Planning to deploy over next few days. This ReadMe will be moved into an older/archive folder for posterity. Hopefully if this model is deployed the way I envision, I'll have a lot of cool stuff on the way in the future!

(Dec 29, 2021): Finished modeling (for the most part). Cleaning up folders, hoping to deploy over New Years.

(Nov 30, 2021): Modeling is underway. I've created a new target column with the goal of using it to cluster (KNN/KMeans?)

(Nov 23, 2021): EDA is underway for Division B lines. I plan on doing two different models and going from there

(Nov 9, 2021): I am currently in the process of updating this for the full MTA. Please stay tuned - hoping to deploy a model by the end of the week!
